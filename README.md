# Carmenda Pseudonymize

Carmenda Pseudonymize is a solution designed to pseudonymize textual data for care organizations. This tool leverages the Deduce algorithm to effectively mask sensitive information, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. Built with PySpark for enhanced performance, it is ideal for handling large datasets efficiently.

## Features

- **Pseudonymization of Textual Data**: Effectively masks sensitive information using the Deduce algorithm.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes PySpark to handle large datasets with speed and efficiency.
- **Easy Deployment**: Available as a Docker image for easy setup and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Installation

To get started with Carmenda Pseudonymize, you'll need to pull the Docker image from the repository:

\`\`\`bash
docker pull your-repo/carmenda-pseudonymize:latest
\`\`\`

### Usage

Run the Docker container with the following command:

\`\`\`bash
docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/your/data:/data your-repo/carmenda-pseudonymize:latest
\`\`\`

Replace \`/path/to/your/data\` with the path to your data directory. This command will mount your local data directory into the Docker container for processing.

### Configuration

The pseudonymization process can be configured using a \`config.json\` file. Please refer to the [Docker Manual](xxx) for detailed configuration options and examples.

## How It Works

Carmenda Pseudonymize uses the Deduce algorithm to replace sensitive information in text data with pseudonyms. This method ensures that the data remains useful for analytical purposes while protecting individual privacy.

### Key Components

- **Deduce Algorithm**: A robust algorithm for pseudonymizing data without losing its utility.
- **PySpark Integration**: Utilizes the distributed computing capabilities of PySpark to process large datasets quickly.
